# Real-Time Sentiment Analysis System

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a real-time sentiment analysis system that can classify text input into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The system will utilize a sentiment analysis model and provide real-time feedback.

## Project Components
Text Processing and Sentiment Analysis:

Use the TextBlob library for sentiment analysis.
Create a function to classify text based on sentiment polarity.
Real-Time Input Handling:

Build a command-line interface (CLI) or a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to handle user input in real-time.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd real_time_sentiment_analysis

2. Install dependencies:

## Deployment:

Optionally deploy the application as a web service or integrate with other platforms for real-time data input.
